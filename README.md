### Plugins for GIMP 2.99+
Currently at the "figuring out what the hell 'introspection' means" phase.

Needs the bszgw.py file from https://github.com/Beinsezii/BSZGW at the root.
Ideally also clone BSZGW and hardlink it so it keeps updated.

## Current Plugins
### Template
Not really a plugin, more of a research into making other *real* plugins.

## Installation
Download the folder somewhere and add it as a 'plug-in' directory in your gimp preferences.
