# bsz-gimp-plugins
### Plugins for GIMP 2.99+
Currently at the "I *think* I understand this now" phase.

Needs the bszgw.py file from https://github.com/Beinsezii/BSZGW at the root. Will be bundled with release tags.

## Current Plugins
### Dual Bloom
Produces both a light and a dark bloom based on thresholds, with as many config options as I can squeeze into GEGL. Best explanation is to try it.

<table class="img-compare">
  <tr>
    <th><img width=200 src="./bsz-dualbloom/before.png" alt="Before" /></th>
    <th><img width=200 src="./bsz-dualbloom/after.png" alt="After" /></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Before</td>
    <td>After</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Installation
Download the folder somewhere and add it as a 'plug-in' directory in your gimp preferences, or unpack the .tar into your existing plugins folder.
